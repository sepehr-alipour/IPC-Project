1. Implementing getCString function was the chalangable fuction that I have
faced in this project. First of all I implemented the function prototype with instruction that
explained in the pdf file and everything work correctly in mileston 1 while in mileston number 2
there are different samples for testing the functionality of getCString. I found that there is  a bug
to get string with space character. So The solution was soled by runnig the program in debug mode and checkig the inputs 
that user entered I figured out that I need to add %[^\n]%c in scanf to solve the issue. 

2. By using helper functions we are able to write modular codes by implementing blocks of codes.
Also, instead of writing the new function which the logic is the same and the output is different, we can implemented
one helper function and use it as many as we need in another functions. Moreover, we can benefit from helper functions
when we have messy codes to have a clean and maintainable code. If any bug appear in our program, we are aware that in wich
helper function we can find the issue.

3. Structure designed for packing different data type together. The important advantage of the structures is that it can 
handle multi data type while arrays are not able to do. We can store and access the data relating to one person without losing
the particular identity even with an enormous amount of data. Finally, by having bunch of data in one structure we can organize the code
to have more clean code.
