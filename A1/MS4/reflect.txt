1. In my point of view, when we will go to the industry, 
we will face customers that they expect to develop some programs with their output result.
For example, consider the front-end developer as a programmer,
 they are responsible for working on the design file that the designer provides them and they should develop the expected design.
 So we need to pay attention to details now in order to be a detailed oriented programmers in future.
 
2. The name of the files should be short and expressive, avoid using special characters,
 we can use the "camelCase" name convention.
 The name should point to the content and the functionality of the context of a file.
 Also, in header files, we always keep our prototypes and in the c files,
 we develop our function bodies. Therefore, first of all, by choosing the same name for header and source code files,
 we are convenient to find the files in the list of solution explorers. On the other hand,
 we can collaborate with team members simply if we follow this structure for all our files in maintenance codes.
 For example in the "accountTicketingUI.h" and "accountTicketingUI.c" files,
 we can recognize that the content of the file is related to showing the output,
 and the codes inside of them are developed for listing or printing some information.
 
3. Cascading menu system framework means that we use menus and sub-menus nested in our program to categorize and classify our menu design.
 The most popular usage of framework is on the websites that we call "menus" or using filters
 that end users are able to narrow down the total list of options before making a final selection.
 For example, when we want to modify an existing account we show another menu to allow users to choose an update account type,
 person data and login data as well.
